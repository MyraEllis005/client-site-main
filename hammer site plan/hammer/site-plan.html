        [Purpose:
        This website is created for those who want to learn or improve snowboard skills. No matter what skill level you are at, this website will be able to cater to your needs by teaching fundamental skills necessary to complete that next trick! 
        
        How this website works:
        There are two other pages in this website, the first one, “Beginner”, teaches people who have typically been snowboarding for 1 year or less. The next page “Intermediate” teaches specific tricks to help you fine tune your snowboarding. Within each page, there are a series of levels that describe a rider's capabilities. This will allow you to pinpoint your ability and teach you what tricks you should be working on. 
        
        How do I know what level I am?
        Beginner snowboarders are considered those who have just started snowboarding all the way to those who have just learned how to carve and can catch air. If you are comfortable with catching air and you can confidently ride toe-edge, then you can focus on progressing your riding!
